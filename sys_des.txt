How to Design Twitter
Compress Twitter to its MVP (minimum viable product)
Only design core features of Twitter instead of everything.
The whole product should allow people follow each other and view others feeds.
Divide the whole system into several core components. (frontend/backend, offline/online)
In this question, I would design solutions for the following two things: 
1. Data modeling.
If we want to use a relational database like MySQL, we can define user object and feed object.
Two relations are also necessary. One is user can follow each other, the other is each feed has a user owner.
2. How to serve feeds.
The most straightforward way is to fetch feeds from all the people you follow and render them by time.


Create a TinyURL System
The length is 7 containing [A-Z, a-z, 0-9], we can serve 62 ^ 7 ~= 3500 billion URLs.
there are ~644 million URLs
Take the first 43-bit of 128-bit MD5 of the long URL.
Convert these 43-bit from base 2 to base 62
